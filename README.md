# 📈 Stock Market Analytics Pipeline

## Overview

The **Stock Market Analytics Pipeline** is an end-to-end data analytics project that automates the process of collecting, transforming, storing, analyzing, and visualizing historical stock market data.

Historical stock data is extracted from the **Yahoo Finance API**, cleaned and transformed using **Python (Pandas)**, stored in **PostgreSQL**, analyzed with **Advanced SQL**, and visualized through **interactive Power BI dashboards**.

The project demonstrates a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflow and provides business insights into stock performance, market trends, volatility, trading activity, and investment analysis.
